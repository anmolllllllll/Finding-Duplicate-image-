Finding duplicate images can be a computationally intensive task, especially if you're dealing with a large number of images. Using parallel distribution can help speed up the process by utilizing multiple processing units (such as CPU cores or GPUs) to perform the duplicate image search simultaneously. Here's a high-level overview of how you could approach this using parallel distribution:

Data Preparation:
Gather all the images you want to compare for duplicates. Store their file paths or unique identifiers in a list or database.

Parallel Distribution:
Divide the list of images into smaller subsets, depending on the number of processing units you have available for parallel processing.

Parallel Processing:
For each subset of images, create a parallel process for comparison. Each process will handle a subset of images independently.

Image Comparison:
Within each process, compare the images in the subset to identify duplicates. There are various techniques to compare images, such as perceptual hashing (like pHash), feature extraction (using deep learning models like CNNs), or even direct pixel-by-pixel comparison (though this is less common due to sensitivity to minor changes).

Duplicate Identification:
As each process identifies duplicate images within its subset, collect and aggregate the duplicate results across all processes.

Results Merging:
After all processes have completed, merge the duplicate results to create a comprehensive list of duplicate images across all subsets.

Final Cleanup:
Review and validate the identified duplicates. Depending on your use case, you might want to keep only one copy of each duplicate group or delete all but one copy.

Reporting and Visualization:
Generate a report or visualization of the duplicate images, including their file paths or identifiers.
Additionally, for even more efficient parallel processing, you could consider utilizing GPU acceleration, especially if you're using deep learning models for image feature extraction.
